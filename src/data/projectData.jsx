      "In this project me and my two other teammates were tasked with creating a job website for our school's guidance department that allowed students to apply to jobs, employers to post jobs, a backend admin to approve/deny jobs, and a page where the jobs are listed. We developed a company and site called TalentLink. The main technologies I used for this site were the Astro JS framework, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Axios, and Node. Astro is a framework that allows you to use multiple frameworks within your project and separate it into modules. I used React to create the components and frontend of the site. I used MongoDB as my database to store all site data (jobs, users, etc). I used Mongoose to create the schemas for the data and to connect to the database. I used Express to create the backend server and Axios to make API calls to the database. I also used CSS and HTML within my React components to style the site and make it look nice. As far as some features of the site, it had a log in with encrpyted passwords, conditional page renders depending on if the user was a student, employer, or admin, carousel elemnts, and procedural generation for jobs. This project was a lot of fun and I learned a lot about how to use these technologies together. I also learned a lot about how to work in a team and communicate with my teammates.",

I used React Native for the frontend, implemented async storage for managing game state and user progression, and added subject and difficulty customization to tailor the learning experience. The app also includes animations, audio integration, and pixel art visuals to provide a seamless, engaging experience.",

This was the first project I developed that was a little bit more advanced. It involved stringing together multiple files, running logic gates to make sure ceratin page elements only loaded on certain pages, storing and retrieving data across multiple files using local storage, procedural js to create page elements, and much much more! This project also won me first place at my FBLA Regional competition and third place at the state competition.
