      "In this project me and my two other teammates were tasked with creating a job website for our school's guidance department that allowed students to apply to jobs, employers to post jobs, a backend admin to approve/deny jobs, and a page where the jobs are listed. We developed a company and site called TalentLink. The main technologies I used for this site were the Astro JS framework, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Axios, and Node. Astro is a framework that allows you to use multiple frameworks within your project and separate it into modules. I used React to create the components and frontend of the site. I used MongoDB as my database to store all site data (jobs, users, etc). I used Mongoose to create the schemas for the data and to connect to the database. I used Express to create the backend server and Axios to make API calls to the database. I also used CSS and HTML within my React components to style the site and make it look nice. As far as some features of the site, it had a log in with encrpyted passwords, conditional page renders depending on if the user was a student, employer, or admin, carousel elemnts, and procedural generation for jobs. This project was a lot of fun and I learned a lot about how to use these technologies together. I also learned a lot about how to work in a team and communicate with my teammates.",

      "For this project, I created Edumon, a complex full-stack turn-based RPG where players collect and battle monsters by answering educational questions to determine the success of their moves. I used React Native for the frontend, implemented async storage for managing game state and user progression, and added subject and difficulty customization to tailor the learning experience. The app also includes animations, audio integration, and pixel art visuals to provide a seamless, engaging experience.",

      "I developed this project for FBLA, specifically the website coding and development competition. This project won first in the regional competition and third in the state competition! This was the first project I developed that was a little bit more advanced. It involved stringing together multiple files, running logic gates to make sure ceratin page elements only loaded on certain pages, storing and retrieving data across multiple files using local storage, procedural js to create page elements, and much much more! This project also won me first place at my FBLA Regional competition and third place at the state competition. I talk a little bit more about FBLA on my <a class='about-link' href='about.html'>about page!</a>",

      "This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and encompasses all of the topics I have learned in my first semester of West-MEC. It is a typing/adventure game (mostly) complete with audio, interactivity, and just a few bugs. It utilizes the JS canvas, eventlisteners, inputs, arrays, and loops which append elements to the DOM. This is just scraping the surface of what this game covers, but I plan to make my projects more in-depth and entertaining in the future.",

      "I created this project at the SkillsUSA state competition in Arizona. This project won first place out of 80+ contestants! I don't quite remember the entire design brief but it went something along the lines of this. There was a film festival being held in Flagstaff AZ called the Copper Canyon Film Festival. The film festival caters to all movie lovers providing them a with a place where they can share their love of movies with others. At the event, there would be movie showcases, movie watching parties, and presentations where film directors get to share their movie making experiences. We were tasked with developing a logo and making a flyer for the client and here is the work I created! I tried making the flyer colorful and vibrant to stand out and relay the idea of the film festival being fun, entertaining, and for everyone to enjoy. For the logo, instead of going with a desert theme I went with a color scheme and symbolism that related more to flagstaff, with the blues, the mountains, and the trees.",

We went through multiple steps to procure the final outcome but I'll briefly lay out the steps. We assigned roles to each member of the group and defined our target audience, our mission, company name, slogan, etc. After that we came up with multiple ideas logos and narrowed it down to the one I made and made multiple variations of it. Then we were tasked with designing an office space and the costs of rent and running our business (consumables, tech, etc). Then we developed a promotional package including business cards, letterheads, etc. Throughout the entire process we wrote up memos to communicate with our client (our teacher) to show us what communication looks like in the professional world.",
